# JS_Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock Paper Scissor Project made with Html, Css and Javascript. (demo)  

At this project, I worked with:
- DOM at JS to manipulate html and css
- Random and select an item from an Array . (random number as an index)
- "forEach" to add Events and function for many items at once
- Detect and store the value of a target event (ex: button click)
- Condicionals to set different funcionalities
- Count and set new values for a variable
- Clean code
